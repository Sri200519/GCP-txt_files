The website from the Child Mind Institute provides a comprehensive guide on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), detailing its definition as a developmental disorder characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and behavior, with a wide range of symptoms and severity. It discusses common symptoms, such as difficulties in understanding social cues, repetitive behaviors, and intense focus on specific topics. Diagnosis is typically based on behavioral observation by age two. The guide explores risk factors like genetics, parental age, and low birth weight, and emphasizes the importance of early intervention through therapies like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), Occupational Therapy, and Speech Therapy. Additionally, it covers associated conditions like epilepsy, ADHD, and anxiety, offering resources for parents and caregivers to support their children and improve their quality of life.
