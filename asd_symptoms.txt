The symptoms include challenges with social communication, repetitive patterns of behavior, and restricted interests, typically emerging in early childhood. The exact cause of ASD is unknown, but both genetic and environmental factors, such as prenatal exposure to certain substances, are believed to play a role. Diagnosis involves developmental screenings and comprehensive evaluations. Early intervention through therapies is emphasized as crucial for improving outcomes.
